# UNL Polymer Web Components
> Polymer components for building web apps at UNL

## Getting Started

### Foreword
This package is currently under heavy development. Things may change, be missing, or not work correctly.

### Installation
Using Bower:
```
bower install unl-components
```
Or, just download the contents of the repository and place it wherever you'd like. Note, if you go this route, you'll need to install the dependencies manually:
- `unl-style`
- `webcomponentsjs`

### Usage
You'll need to import a few things to get started:
```html
<script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.min.js"></script>
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/unl-components/dist/unl-components.html">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/unl-style/dist/unl-style.css" shim-shadowdom/>
```

## Using the Components
Coming soon :/
